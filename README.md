Forager's Insight is a work-in-progress addon for Farmer's Delight. This aims to add crop or crop-like interactions to some flora and trees, giving uses other than dyes and wood. 

In addition, the mod also aims to add XP interactions for harvesting and foraging crops.

Players will be introduced to new tools, enchantments, blocks and dishes to help them on their foraging journeys.

This mod is still in **development**.
